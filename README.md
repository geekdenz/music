```bash
node index.js 'Em Em7 A Cmaj7 Bm C Bm D'

# Em | Em7 | A | Cmaj7 | Bm | C | Bm | D
# Gb A Db | Gb A Db E | B Eb Gb | D F A Db | Db E Ab | D Gb A | Db E Ab | E Ab B
```

Note at this stage only b are supported, so you may get unexpected b where there
should be #. The resulting pitch should be the same though, so I thought I'd
just leave that for now.
